It's because our public headers need to be C-compatible, but, for safety security, we are slowly moving the library to C++. This means we need to play slightly iffy games where our internal translation units see slightly different typedefs.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is to go back to the \"ssl_st subclasses bssl::SSLConnection\" idea and hope it doesn't emit any symbols to pollute the namespace. I'll see if I can get that working.",
