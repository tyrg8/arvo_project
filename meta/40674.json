Wasn't the fix landed in cd021a1311572d4f9bb37b0b808685a5ed84bcc3 ? At least that commit changes the function in which the heap overflow occurs, which is later than eeec32b6f674efa8eacc72c656fc9a2f44f8e482 revision where it was last tested.\n\nIn either case, I just tested locally and can confirm the bug no longer exists.
