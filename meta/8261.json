One is that Tor was using OpenSSL's previously documented (though apparently unintentional) semantics for password callbacks. These semantics are changing in 1.1.1.\r\n\r\nTo fix Tor's return value: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/26116\r\n\r\nTo fix OpenSSL's documentation: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/6271\r\n\r\nThe second bug is that OpenSSL does in fact use ininitialized memory when attempting to decrypt certain PEM-encrypted values.  After discussing this with the openssl devs, I've opened a ticket for them at https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6347"
