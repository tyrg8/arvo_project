Using these random parameters may generate segfaults just like calling a C function that takes pointers may crash if a bad pointer is given. Please don't use this fuzzing as it only makes noise and hides true vulnerabilities discovering. An ICC profile that generates segfaults when opened or used in a transform is Ok. Calling API functions with erroneous parameters is not, attackers don't have access to the API. Won't fix."
