I've just confirmed that MSan on my compiler is fine with that, and we'd definitely have noticed by now if we broke that one. :-)\n\nIn the past, we've had a number of issues where a new Clang on OSS-Fuzz regressed some corner of MSan around NUL-terminated strings. Something like that may be happening again."
