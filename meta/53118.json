It was exposed in the evolving libjpeg-turbo 2.2.x code base when I recently incorporated 12-bit data precision into the libjpeg API library, which exposed the 12-bit code paths to OSS-Fuzz for the first time.  The issue can also be reproduced by building the libjpeg-turbo 2.1.x and 2.0.x stable code bases with -DWITH_12BIT=1 and trying to transform a baseline 12-bit JPEG file into a progressive 12-bit JPEG file using jpegtran.  I am investigating."
