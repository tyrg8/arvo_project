The bug does not exist in 2.0.6 (which now lives in a sustaining branch called \u201c2.0.x\u201d) or any prior version.\n\nNote to downstream project maintainers, since this bug almost immediately popped up in ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick as well:\n\nThe master branch of libjpeg-turbo is \"always stable\", but \u201calways stable\" in this case means that it is used for beta releases as well. If you don't want to pull beta code, then you'll need to be mindful of our release cycle and switch to the sustaining branch while the code is in beta, or you'll need to build from specific Git tags.\n\n"
