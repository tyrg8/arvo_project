The issue was due to the fact that decompression scaling is silently disabled with lossless JPEG images (because decompression scaling is a function of the IDCT.)  The TurboJPEG API had to be expanded to give calling programs the ability to detect lossless JPEG images, so they will know that their decompression scaling requests will be ignored.\n"
