The variable it is reporting as uninitialized is definitely initialized.  valgrind doesn't complain, which lends more credence to this being an MSan false positive.  Note that this issue is only reproducible in the 2.1.x and 2.0.x branches, not in the main (3.0.x) branch.  The issue was exposed because of https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/19f9d8f0fd9d753a7af3d5b4d58e20f9d752f5c0, which modified the transform fuzzer so that it executes all transforms rather than aborting if the first transform fails."

It is a legitimate issue in the C Huffman encoder that is only exposed because we can't use the libjpeg-turbo SIMD extensions with MSan.  (Normally the Huffman encoder is SIMD-accelerated on x86 and Arm CPUs, so the C Huffman encoder is never used.)  The issue is in fact reproducible in 3.0.x but wasn't reproducing because of a bug in the transform fuzzer as well as some changes in the 3.0.x version of the fuzzer that were meant to improve coverage.  The issue has been fixed in the main (3.0.x), 2.1.x, and 2.0.x branches."
