This context is more important because it affects the main compression function LZ4_compress_fast. This bug is present in the latest release, and has been present since at least 2014.\n\nWe've previously missed this bug for two reasons:\n1. We previously fuzzed compression with output buffers that are guaranteed to be large enough.\n2. This bug requires a large input to trigger (many KB), and we weren't fuzzing with that large of inputs.\n\nThis bug is already fixed by https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/756.",
