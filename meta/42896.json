That function increments buf without checking it, and at that point we have exhausted the buffer (buf == bufend) because we've advanced past the end of the buffer we end up trying to read a whole load of NULL bytes and eventually fall off the end of memory. This doesn't crash on Windows, I think because the hex decode filter runs across fatal garbage in the uninitialised memory before we get that far and aborts the stream with an error. I think we should simply check there is at least one byte in the buffer before incrementing the pointer here:\n\n    /* Because of streams <shrug!> we advance the buffer one byte */\n    buf++;\n\nThat's line 903 of pdf_fontps.c for me."
