I'm going to investigate this one a little further it looks like an off by one kind of error. At a brief glance, it may be that `std::string::size()` [in my fuzz harness](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/blob/master/fuzz/roundtrip.cc#L16) may include the null terminator, which might affect the end result, but I would have thought that this wouldn't have been a problem. Specifically I would have thought that is a null terminator wasn't considered \"valid utf\" it would have exited [here](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/blob/master/fuzz/roundtrip.cc#L11).\n\nAnyway these are all just guesses so and I'll need to do a deeper dive to understand what the issue is :)"
