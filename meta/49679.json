This flag is used only by e2fsck, because it does its own superblock consistency checking, and we want to print more user-friendly explanations about why the file system is corrupted.  In this particular case, s_inodes_count in the fs image was set to zero, which would have been caught by ext2fs_open(), but for EXT2_FLAG_IGNORE_SB_ERRORS, so this failure could never happen in real world programs."
