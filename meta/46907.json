I believe this would come from ostree's use of GRegex and then glib's regex implementation using PCRE.\n\nTrying out the oss-fuzz locally, I see glib is building pcre using the wrapdb subproject. Unfortunately, that's pcre 8.37 per https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/497aba96f115a8769fa66090c4146de851ac10df/subprojects/pcre.wrap. That's very old, and looking at the PCRE changelog between then and the current 8.45 there have been a bunch of overflow fixes.\n\nSo, I think either the build should be changed so that PCRE is installed from the system (and hopefully it's more recent/secure) or the glib PCRE wrapdb should be updated."

I didn't look close enough to see what the oss-fuzz-base/base-builder image is based on, but since it's using apt, I think installing libpcre3-dev would get the system version.
