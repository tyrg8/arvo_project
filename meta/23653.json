As such, the risk that future reports spot bugs that already affect stable branches remains low.\n\nLast, in its current form, oss-fuzz makes it almost impossible to forward issues and their details to other people as is usually done using emails, so by having just a few people there we're creating a bottleneck which increases the time to fix issues and the duration of user exposure. By making issues public we will help share them with the relevant maintainer/author and this will significantly increase the available bandwidth and reduce the time to fix them.\n\nSo I'm all for making this publicly available. And if, in the worst case, something would require a quick fix, at least we can be certain that nobody would sleep on it.\n\nThanks!"
