 - move some docs from the wiki and blog into core libvips docs
 - add support for markdown in docs
 
 25/3/17 started 8.5.1
 - init more classes earlier, thanks David
 
 13/10/16 started 8.5.0
 - rewritten buffer system is safer and frees memory earlier
 - added tiff save to buffer
 - added dzsave save to buffer (zip only)
 - revise header get/set functions
 - better vipsheader behaviour with complex field types
 - added vips_image_hasalpha()
 - added vips_thumbnail() / vips_thumbnail_buffer()
 - webpload/webpsave read and write icc, xmp, exif metadata
 - better >4gb detect for zip dzsave output [Felix Bünemann]
 - all loaders have a @fail option, meaning fail on first warning, though it
   only does anything for jpg and csv
 - add vips_image_get_fields() to help bindings
 - add tiff multi-page read/write
 - add VIPS_META_PAGE_HEIGHT metadata
 - IM6/IM7 magickload supports page/n/page-height, all_frames deprecated
 - gifload supports n/page-height
 - added #defines for VIPS_SONAME, VIPS_LIBRARY_CURRENT, VIPS_LIBRARY_REVISION,
   VIPS_LIBRARY_AGE
 - better support for bscale / bzero in fits images
 - deprecate vips_warn() / vips_info(); use g_warning() / g_info() instead
 - vipsthumbnail supports much fancier geometry strings, thanks tomasc
 - vips_thumbnail() has new @size option
 - fix --vips-cache-max etc. 
 - add compute reordering, plus some new API to support it:
   vips_reorder_margin_hint() and vips_reorder_prepare_many(), thanks
   aferrero2707
 - kick load operations from cache on read error, thanks gaillard 
 - fix return from C++ assignment operator overloads (+=, -= etc) 
 - add @max_slope to vips_hist_local() to implement CLAHE, thanks hunter-87
 - vips_gaussnoise() pixels are reproducible on recalc, thanks MvGulik
 - max/min sort values by y and x coordinate
 - tiff read uses libtiff scanline API if rows-per-strip is large
 - vips_region_shrink() knows about alpha, helps dzsave and tiffsave
 - use expat, not libxml, for XML load ... removes a required dependency, since
   we get expat as part of glib
 - new sequential mode infrastructure is faster and more flexible
 - add vips_smartcrop(), based on sharp's smartcropper
 - vipsthumbnail has a --smartcrop option
 - added vips_rot90() etc. convenience functions
 - fix vips_resize() bug when hscale and vscale were very different
 
 8/12/16 started 8.4.5
 - allow libgsf-1.14.26 to help centos, thanks tdiprima
 
 11/11/16 started 8.4.4
 - fix crash in vips.exe arg parsing on Windows, thanks Yury
 
 18/10/16 started 8.4.3
 - fix error detection in gif_close, thanks aaron42net
 - fix tiny threading memleak
 - improve compatibility with very old glib, see #548
 
 27/9/16 started 8.4.2
 - small doc improvements
 - fix error message for metadata fetch type mismatch
 - resolve a race condition in thread shutdown, thanks Lovell
 
 1/5/16 started 8.4
 - many more wepsave options [Felix Bünemann]
 - added quant_table option to wepsave [Felix Bünemann]
 - added @n option to pdfload, thanks andris
 - dzsave won't write empty tiles in google mode, thanks bverem, perog,
   felixbuenemann
 - allow nested [] in CLI args
 - restore BandFmt on unpremultiply in vipsthumbnail
 - better python detection and build [Felix Bünemann]
 - max-alpha defaults to 65535 for RGB16/GREY16
 - added radsave_buffer [Henri Chain]
 - support tiff orientation tag
 - autorotate option for tiff load
 - tiffsave converts for jpg if jpg compression is turned on
 - tiffsave supports --strip
 - conversions to GREY16 could lock
 - free pixel buffers on image close as well as thread exit ... stops main 
   thread buffers clogging up the system
 - dzsave can write compressed zips [Felix Bünemann]
 - vips_image_write() only refs the input when it has to ... makes it easier to
   combine many images in bounded memory
 - VImage::write() implementation was missing
 - VImage::write() return value changed from void to VImage to help chaining
 - added C++ arithmetic assignment overloads, += etc. 
 - VImage::ifthenelse() with double args was missing =0 on options
 - better accuracy for reducev with smarter multiplication
 - better quality for vips_resize() with linear/cubic kernels 
 - pyvips8 can create new metadata
 - better upsizing with vips_resize()
 - add imagemagick v7 support, thanks sachinwalia2k8 
 - added vips_worley(), vips_perlin() noise generators
 - added vips_convf(), vips_convi(), vips_convasep(), vips_conva() ... 
   im_conv*() functions rewritten as classes
 - vips_convsep() calls vips_convasep() for the approximate case
 - new fixed-point vector path for convi is up to about 2x faster
 - gif loader can make 1, 2, 3, or 4 bands depending on file contents
 - support --strip for pngsave
 - add svgz support [Felix Bünemann]
 - rename boostrap.sh -> autogen.sh to help snapcraft
 - support unicode filenames on Windows 
 - added VIPS_ROUND as well as VIPS_RINT
 - resize/reduce*/shrink*/affine now round output size to nearest rather than 
   rounding down, thanks ioquatix
 - better support for tile overlaps in google maps mode in dzsave
 - dzsave puts vips-properties.xml in the main dir for gm and zoomify layouts
 - resize and reduce have @centre option for centre convention downsampling
 - vipsthumbnail uses centre convention to better match imagemagick
