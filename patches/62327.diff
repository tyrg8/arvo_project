@@ -4,13 +4,17 @@ Backported patches from the vanilla LuaJIT trunk (gh-8825). The following issues
 were fixed as part of this activity:
 
 * Fixed `BC_UCLO` insertion for returns.
 * Fixed recording of `BC_VARG` with unused vararg values.
 * Initialization instructions on trace are now emitted only for the first
   member of a union.
 * Prevent integer overflow while parsing long strings.
 * Fixed various `^` operator and `math.pow()` function inconsistencies.
 * Fixed parsing with predicting `next()` and `pairs()`.
 * Fixed binary number literal parsing. Parsing of binary number with a zero
   fractional part raises error too now.
 * Fixed load forwarding optimization applied after table rehashing.
 * Fixed recording of the `BC_TSETM`.
+* Fixed the panic routine when `mprotect` fails to change flags for mcode area.
+* Fixed frame for on-trace OOM handling.
+* Fixed handling of instable types in TNEW/TDUP load forwarding.
+* Handled table unsinking in the presence of `IRFL_TAB_NOMM`.
