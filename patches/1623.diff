+This directory contain fuzzer main funtions and scripts for the
+Google OSS Fuzz project: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/
+
+The main build scripts are in:
+https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/gdal
+and call scripts in this directory.
+
+The list of issues is in:
+https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=gdal
+
+- Simple build of fuzzer main functions:
+    $ make
+
+- Simulate the build of (dummy) fuzzers like OSS Fuzz does:
+    $ make dummyfuzzers
+  They are created in /tmp/*_fuzzer as well as with the
+  /tmp/*_fuzzer_seed_corpus.zip files
+  
+  Run one:
+    $ /tmp/ogr_fuzzer a_file_name
+
+- Run locally OSS Fuzz:
+    $ git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
+    $ cd oss-fuzz
+    $ export PROJECT_NAME=gdal
+    $ python infra/helper.py build_image $PROJECT_NAME
+
+  Build fuzzers with the address sanitizer (could use undefined, etc...)
+    $ python infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --sanitizer address $PROJECT_NAME
+
+  Test a particular fuzzer (replace shape_fuzzer by other fuzzers
+  like the ones generated in /tmp by "make dummyfuzzers")
+    $ python infra/helper.py run_fuzzer $PROJECT_NAME shape_fuzzer
