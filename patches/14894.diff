 -  **VALIDATE**\ =YES/NO: whether the document should be validated

    is NO.
 -  **FAIL_IF_VALIDATION_ERROR**\ =YES/NO: Whether a validation error

    pointed by xlink:href links should be downloaded from the server even
    if already present in the local cache. If the cache is enabled, it
    will be refreshed with the newly downloaded resources. Default is NO.
 -  **SWAP_COORDINATES**\ =AUTO/YES/NO: Whether the order of the x/y or
    long/lat coordinates should be swapped. In AUTO mode, the driver will
    determine if swapping must be done from the srsName. If the srsName
    is urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::XXXX and that the order of coordinates in
    the EPSG database for this SRS is lat,long or northing,easting, then
    the driver will swap them to the GIS friendly order (long,lat or
    easting,northing). For other forms of SRS (such as EPSG:XXXX), GIS
    friendly order is assumed and thus no swapping is done. When

 -  **LAYERS**\ =layers. Comma separated list of layers to export as
    top-level features. The special value "{SPATIAL_LAYERS}" can also be
    used to specify all layers that have geometries. When LAYERS is not
    specified, the driver will identify in the source dataset "top-level"
    layers, and in those layers will find which features are not
    referenced by other top-level layers.
 -  **SRSNAME_FORMAT**\ =SHORT/OGC_URN/OGC_URL (Only valid for GML 3
    output) Defaults to OGC_URL. If SHORT, then srsName will be in the
    form AUTHORITY_NAME:AUTHORITY_CODE If OGC_URN, then srsName will be
    in the form urn:ogc:def:crs:AUTHORITY_NAME::AUTHORITY_CODE If
    OGC_URL, then srsName will be in the form
    http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/AUTHORITY_NAME/0/AUTHORITY_CODE For
    OGC_URN and OGC_URL, in the case the SRS is a SRS without explicit
    AXIS order, but that the same SRS authority code imported with
    ImportFromEPSGA() should be treated as lat/long or northing/easting,
    then the function will take care of coordinate order swapping.
 -  **INDENT_SIZE**\ =[0-8]. Number of spaces for each indentation level.
    Default is 2.
 -  **COMMENT**\ =string. Comment to add at top of generated XML file as
    a XML comment.
 -  **LINEFORMAT**\ =CRLF/LF. End-of-line sequence to use. Defaults to
    CRLF on Windows and LF on other platforms.
 -  **WRAPPING**\ =WFS2_FEATURECOLLECTION/GMLAS_FEATURECOLLECTION.
    Whether to wrap features in a wfs:FeatureCollection or in a
    ogr_gmlas:FeatureCollection. Defaults to WFS2_FEATURECOLLECTION.
 -  **TIMESTAMP**\ =XML date time. User-specified XML dateTime value for
    timestamp to use in wfs:FeatureCollection attribute. If not
    specified, current date time is used. Only valid for
    WRAPPING=WFS2_FEATURECOLLECTION.

 -  **OUTPUT_XSD_FILENAME**\ =string. Wrapping .xsd filename. If not
    specified, same basename as output file with .xsd extension. Note
    that it is possible to use this option even if GENERATE_XSD=NO, so
    that the wrapping .xsd appear in the schemaLocation attribute of the
