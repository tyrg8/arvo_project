         Bug fixes:
               #8  If the parser runs out of memory, make sure its internal
                     state reflects the memory it actually has, not the memory
                     it wanted to have.
              #11  The default handler wasn't being called when it should for
                     a SYSTEM or PUBLIC doctype if an entity declaration handler
                     was registered.
        #137 #138  Fix a case of mistakenly reported parsing success where
                     XML_StopParser was called from an element handler
