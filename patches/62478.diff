    archive: ensure files are written in binary mode (#3694)
    
    On POSIX-compliant operating systems (e.g. Linux, macOS), there is
    no difference between binary mode and text mode, but Windows
    transforms line feeds ("\n") to "\r\n" sequences during write
    operations, resulting in corrupted images.
