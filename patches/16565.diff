 /**
  * vips_rawload:
  * @filename: file to load
  * @out: (out): output image
  * @width: width of image in pixels
  * @height: height of image in pixels
  * @bands: number of image bands
  * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
  *
  * Optional arguments:
  *
  * * @offset: %guint64, offset in bytes from start of file
+ * * @format: #VipsBandFormat, set image format
+ * * @interpretation: #VipsInterpretation, set image interpretation
  *
  * This operation mmaps the file, setting up @out so that access to that 
  * image will read from the file. 
  *
- * @out will be a 8-bit uchar image with @bands image bands, so @bands can 
- * be thought of as meaning "number of bytes per pixel". Use functions 
- * like vips_copy() to set the exact band format, number of bands, 
- * and so on. Use vips_byteswap() to reverse the byte ordering. 
+ * By default, it assumes uchar pixels. Use @format to select something else.
+ *
+ * The image will be tagged as #VIPS_INTERPRETATION_MULTIBAND. Use
+ * @interpretation to select something else.
+ *
+ * Use vips_byteswap() to reverse the byte ordering if necessary. 
  *
  * See also: vips_image_new_from_file(), vips_copy(), vips_byteswap().
  *
  * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
