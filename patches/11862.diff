    ofp-actions: Avoid overflow for ofpact_learn_spec->n_bits
    
    ofpact_learn_spec->n_bits is the size of immediate data that is
    following ofpact_learn_spec. Now it is defined as 'uint8_t'.
    In many places, it gets its value directly from mf_subfield->n_bits,
    whose type is 'unsigned int'. If input is large enough, there will
    be uint8_t overflow.
    
    For example, the following command will make ovs-ofctl crash:
    ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "table=0, priority=0, action=learn(limit=20  tun_metadata15=0x60ff00000000000003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002fffffffffffffff0ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)"
    
    This patch fixies this issue by changing type of ofpact_learn_spec->n_bits
    from uint8_t to uint32_t.
