 /* The date below is automatically updated every day by a bot.  During
    development, we include the date in the tools' version strings
    (visible in 'ld -v' etc.) because people build binutils from a
    variety of sources - git, tarballs, distro sources - and we want
    something that can easily identify the source they used when they
    report bugs.  The bfd version plus date is usually good enough for
    that purpose.
 
    During development, this date ends up in libbfd and libopcodes
    sonames because people naturally expect shared libraries with the
    same soname to have compatible ABIs.  We could bump the bfd version
    on every ABI change, but that's just another thing contributors and
    maintainers would need to remember.  Instead, it's much easier for
    all if the soname contains the date.  This is not perfect but is
    good enough.
 
    In releases, the date is not included in either version strings or
    sonames.  */
