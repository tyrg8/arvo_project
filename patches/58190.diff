    mvcdec: Bitstream buf allocation accounts for FGC SEI
    
    The worst case FGC SEI payload size in cojunction with the worst
    case sizes of other NALU's can be significantly larger than the
    default bitstream buffer size of 256000. It is now set to the sum
    of 256000 and MAX_FGC_SEI_SIZE.
    
    Bug: ossFuzz:58190
