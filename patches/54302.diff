    Revert "gsimpleproxyresolver: Make explicit that a port is needed for HTTP/HTTPS"
    
    This reverts commit eb12afed6f36db6212228b1e1fbaf87ed5606173
    
    Instead, let's allow use of URIs without ports specified, which
    indicates that a default port should be used.

   /**
    * GSimpleProxyResolver:ignore-hosts:
    *
    * A list of hostnames and IP addresses that the resolver should
    * allow direct connections to.
    *
    * Entries can be in one of 4 formats:
    *
    * - A hostname, such as "example.com", ".example.com", or
    *   "*.example.com", any of which match "example.com" or
    *   any subdomain of it.
    *
    * - An IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as "192.168.1.1",
    *   which matches only that address.
    *
    * - A hostname or IP address followed by a port, such as
    *   "example.com:80", which matches whatever the hostname or IP
    *   address would match, but only for URLs with the (explicitly)
    *   indicated port. In the case of an IPv6 address, the address
    *   part must appear in brackets: "[::1]:443"
    *
    * - An IP address range, given by a base address and prefix length,
    *   such as "fe80::/10", which matches any address in that range.
    *
    * Note that when dealing with Unicode hostnames, the matching is
    * done against the ASCII form of the name.
    *
    * Also note that hostname exclusions apply only to connections made
    * to hosts identified by name, and IP address exclusions apply only
    * to connections made to hosts identified by address. That is, if
    * example.com has an address of 192.168.1.1, and the :ignore-hosts list
    * contains only "192.168.1.1", then a connection to "example.com"
    * (eg, via a #GNetworkAddress) will use the proxy, and a connection to
    * "192.168.1.1" (eg, via a #GInetSocketAddress) will not.
    *
    * These rules match the "ignore-hosts"/"noproxy" rules most
    * commonly used by other applications.
